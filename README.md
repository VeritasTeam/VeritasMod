VeritasMod
==========

This is the official hub for Veritas Overhaul Mod for Skyrim "The Truth Will Set You Free!"

In this hub you will find a few files and a few folders. In the Folder labeled playtest is the packaged mod files, and has been cleaned ready to be played. 
The loose files that you find in the main section here is the files we are currently working on ie; Development files.

if you want to test Veritas, we recommend that you download the playtest, as to using the development files you do at your own risk. (Don't say you weren't warned.)
Mod Team for convenience I have put together a devkit that can install easily to Mod Organizer or Nexus Mod Manager. or you can download the files seperately.

The Files
===========
Veritas.esp is the core file. You will need this file to play the mod, or for any of the plugins to work.
Veritas - Combat AI.esp is a plugin that amps up the Worlds AI to be more realistic and immersive.
Veritas - Supernatural.esp is a plugin that overhauls all of the supernatural/undead aspects of Skyrim, making Vampires what they should be and Werewolves the dominant predator/aggressor they should be as well.

Veritas - Sundered Kingdoms.esp is the Quest plugin that creates a huge Grand Questline that will take the player over their limits. (See description on the Veritas Thread on Nexus)
